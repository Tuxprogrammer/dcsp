### Statement of Work

We will design and implement a web site for a web messaging service. Our website will include a database that supports the management of users and the messaging groups they create. Authentication is required for logging into the web site for users who wish to participate in the messaging groups. Users will also be able to create their own groups which may be either public, private, or an in-between option yet to be named where users will request to join a group based on the public group description. Users that create the group will have additional permissions such as banning a user from the group and removing messages from the group. Visitors will be able to view the public messaging groups without logging in; however, messaging will require users to log in.
